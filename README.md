# Wrangle-and-Analyze-WeRateDogs-DAND
- This project is part of Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity
- The purpose of this project is to Wrangle and Analyze twitter data from "WeRateDogs"
- Gather:
  - We used tweepy library in python and tweet ID to query each tweet's json data and stored in json file
  - Downloaded a file programmatically using the requests library on Udacity website 
  - A file was given by Udacity which I downloaded
  - Joining the individual dataframes
- Assess:
  - Assesed the data visually and programmatically using a juypter notebook
- Clean:
  - Defined the items to be cleaned
  - Code
  - Test the items, once cleaned
- Conclusion:
 -This project was about going through the data wrangle process with some basic analyis
 
#### This is the hardest project in Data Analyst program going through the process of gathering, detecting and documenting and assessing our data, recording the quality and tidiness issues in our data and going through the cleaning process programmtically in a python jupyter notebook
#### By far one of the harder projects, but a good learning experience in the data wrangling process
